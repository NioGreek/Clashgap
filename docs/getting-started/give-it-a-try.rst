This page assumes that you have already :doc:`installed clashgap<installation>`

Open a compatible Python shell and follow along

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import clashgap as cg

   >>> cg.gap(["spam", "ham"])
   [['sp', 'h'], 'am']

   >>> cg.fill([['sp', 'h'], 'am'])
   ["spam", "ham"]

You have successfully demonstrated the usage of the :doc:`gap<../fundamental-functions/gap>` and :doc:`fill<../fundamental-functions/fill>` functions, which are the most fundamental function in the clashgap module. Also chack out other features in the module like the :doc:`Clash class<../advanced-features/clash>`.
